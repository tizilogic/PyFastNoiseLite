# Cython wrapper for the [FastNoise Lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise/) library

This wraps Auburns' great [FastNoise Lite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoise/)
library using Cython  for use in Python 3.6+

## Installation

This package is available on the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.org) both
as source and binary distribution for a variety of Python versions and
platforms using the following command:

```bash
pip install pyfastnoiselite  # On some systems, "pip" has to be replaced by "pip3"
```

> __Note__:
>
> This wrapper currently lacks the domain warping functionality and
> documentation. Both are planned to be added in the future.
